Description: Fits dose-response models using an evolutionary
    algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The procedure currently
    can fit 3-parameter, 4-parameter, and 5-parameter log-logistic models
    as well as exponential models. Functions are also provided to plot,
    make predictions, and calculate confidence intervals for the resulting
    models. For details see "Nonlinear Dose-response Modeling of
    High-Throughput Screening Data Using an Evolutionary Algorithm",
